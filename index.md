## About me
I am a computer science student at the University of Illinois. While I am new to this field of study, I'm currently working on a few projects that have solidified my interest in this subject. I plan on pursuing network and security during my time here. 


Outside of the classroom, I have been playing soccer my whole life. My time spent on the Chicago Fire Academy was a childhood dream come true [https://www.chicago-fire.com/academy/98-99](https://www.chicago-fire.com/academy/98-99). We were allowed free entry to Chicago Fire games, 15% off adidas cleats, free transportation/hotels, a coach from Spain, and other amazing perks. I also enjoy fishing, which is something I do with my family every year in Florida. Some of the craziest catches include mating horseshoe crabs and a bullshark.
